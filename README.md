## Inspiration
I was inspired by school-specific social platforms like Yik-Yak and wanted to adapt this model to foster academic learning and strengthen relationships."

## How we built it
flask, html, css, selenium

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of having any frontend at all, although I didn't get much of the backend done.

## What we learned
I learned a significant bit of html, css, and javascript. It was my first time initializing a frontend and being able to flesh it out this much. I also learned a bit about datascraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium. 

## What's next for Fuse
I didn't get time to implement AI apis, or the leaderboard tab. In the future, I'd like to use genAI to summarize class notes/slides that are uploaded and create flashcards or practice questions.
I had also wanted to make a leaderboard tab where students could form groups and try to achieve the highest combined Leetcode streak. That way students could encourage each other to get their daily practice in while having a bit of friendly competition between teams.
